    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I am a CS PhD student in School of Interactive Computing at Georgia Tech, advised by Professor 
      <a href="https://va.gatech.edu/endert/">Alex Endert</a> and 
      <a href="https://tiles.cc.gatech.edu/people/dr-jessica-roberts-lab-director/">Jessica Roberts</a>. 
      I received my B.S. in Computer Science and Technology from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, and 
      M.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the Ohio State. Before beginning my PhD studies, 
      I was a software development engineer in Amazon Detroit.
    </p>
    <p>
      My research interests are information visualization and humanâ€“computer interaction. I am 
      particularly interested in designing interactive visualization systems that help users explore 
      complex data, identify patterns, and make informed decisions. More broadly, I aim to create 
      user-centered tools that improve the accessibility and effectiveness of data-driven analysis.
